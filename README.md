## The Hacking Group

To prove I belong in a hacking group, I have made this Laravel application that meet the following requirements:

- Users require a stronger password instead of the standard 8-character requirement.
- The application handles forgotten passwords in such a way that is at least secure enough but also easy to implement
- The application encourages the use of password managers
- The *login throttling* parameters can be configured
- The applications passwords are protected against *rainbow table attacks*
